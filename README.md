Hi World!

You are an amazing place where everyone is trying to make sense of what they are capable of and what they truly love. Fortunately for me, I've found it, I love being an entrepreneur and writing codes. I am now leaving my corporate job after 5 years to become at CTO and Co-Founder at a small (for now) start-up. This is going to be quite a ride!
